Parent Orchestrator
  - sees a big, multi-step, code-heavy task
  - decides:
      "I should call child_code_agent with the full request"

      v
Go Membrane
  - sees tool is "child_code_agent" (a child model call)
  - starts a CHILD SESSION:

    Child Code Agent Model

       +-> calls tools like:
           - fs_read / fs_write
           - git_diff
           - http_get (for docs)
           - code_model (specialized)

    Child Code Agent returns a structured result
      |
      v
Go Membrane
  - passes child result back to parent as tool output
      |
      v
Parent Orchestrator
  - integrates child result into a final, user-friendly answer
