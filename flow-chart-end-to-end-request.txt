        v
(2) AnythingLLM sends request
    to Go Membrane
        |
        v
(3) Go Membrane calls
    Parent Orchestrator Model
    with:
      - user message
      - list of AVAILABLE CHILD AGENTS
        (each child is exposed as a "tool")
        |
        v
(4) Parent Orchestrator thinks:
      - can I answer directly?
      - or should I use a child agent?
        |
        +--> if direct answer:
        |       return answer to Go Membrane
        |       (skip children/tools)
        |
        +--> if needs child:
                returns a tool_call like:
                  {
                    "tool": "child_code_agent",
                    "args": { "prompt": "..." }
                  }
                |
                v
(5) Go Membrane sees tool_call:
      - recognizes it's a CHILD CALL
        (not a raw filesystem/http tool)
      - routes to corresponding child agent
        |
        v
(6) Child Agent loop:
      - Go Membrane calls Child Model
        ("code_agent model")
        - with child-specific tools registered
      - Child model may:
          - ask to use http_get, fs_read, embeddings, etc.
          - Go Membrane runs those tools
          - feeds results back to child
      - Child returns a final result to Go Membrane
        |
        v
(7) Go Membrane passes child result
    back to Parent Orchestrator
        |
        v
(8) Parent Orchestrator:
      - incorporates child result
      - produces final answer
        |
        v
(9) Go Membrane sends final answer
    back to AnythingLLM
        |
